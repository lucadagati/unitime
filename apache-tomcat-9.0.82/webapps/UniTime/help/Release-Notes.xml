			<name>Course Finder: Filter</name>
			<description>
				<line>Course Finder dialog on the Scheduling Assistant, Course Requests, and Advisor Course Recommendations pages improved.</line>
				<line>Added Filter section, which allows for filtering courses by:
					<line>Class start/end date (given course must have an enrollment that does not start before the given From date, or lasts past the To date)</line>
					<line>Min/max credit</line>
					<line>Instructor name (given course must have a class with matching instructor name)</line>
				</line>
				<line>Notes:
					<line>Classes that do not display instructors are not considered by the instructor filter.</line>
					<line>Classes that are not enabled for student scheduling are ignored (both instructor and class dates filters).</line>
					<line>The filter is ONLY used for the list of courses, it does not guarantee that the student gets a class with the given instructor or within the given dates.</line>
					<line>When used on the Student Course Requests page or Advisor Course Recommendations page at the time when the schedule of classes has not been published yet,
						only allow for credit filter (no filtering by class dates or instructor names until the schedule of classes is published).</line>

			<name>Student Scheduling Rules</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added student scheduling rules that can be used to define which courses a particular group of students can request/enroll in.These rules can be defined on Administration > Other > Student Scheduling Rules page.</line>
				<line>A group of students can be a student filter (same format as on the dashboards, e.g., group:SpecialStudents or primary-major:%-OL).</line>
				<line>Each group of students can be restricted to particular course types (provided using a regular expression, e.g., !No Pre-Reg),
					course names (provided using a regular expression, e.g, .*[0-9]OL for all courses with OL suffix),
					or instructional methods (provided using a regular expression, e.g., PO|PH for course configurations with PO or PH instructional methods).
					<line>A course name or instructional method regular expression can be negated by using an exclamation mark as a prefix (e.g., !.*[0-9]OL for all courses without an OL suffix).</line>
					<line>If multiple expressions are provided (e.g., both course and instructional method), depending on the mode of the rule, all of the expressions must match or just one.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Each rule can be restricted by a regular expression matching academic initiative, a regular expression matching term, start and end year.</line>
				<line>The rules are processed in the given order.</line>
				<line>For each student, the first matching rule is used (there are no course or instructional method restrictions when no rule applies).</line>
				<line>A rule can apply only to filter (ability to lookup a course), online scheduling, and/or batch scheduling.Advisors and/or admins may be allowed to ignore the rule (there could be special courses that only advisors and/or admins can put the students in).</line>

		<title>Batch Student Scheduling</title>
		<item>
			<name>Solver Load: Replace Pending courses with Substitutes</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to treat substitute course demands as primary when a primary course demand was skipped entirely due to one of the following reasons:
					<line>pending override request (when Load.ReplacePendingWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>canceled override request (when Load.ReplaceCancelledWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>rejected override request (when Load.ReplaceRejectedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
					<line>not offered course (when Load.ReplaceNotOfferedWithSubstitute is true, defaults to false)</line>
				</line>
				<line>More precisely, when a course demand is skipped (all its courses are skipped for some reason),
					and at least one of the courses is skipped due to a reason that is enabled, then
					<line>Take the top most substitute course demand and treat it as primary.</line>
					<line>The position of the substitute course is kept (it shows at the bottom of the primary requests instead of at the top of the substitutes).</line>
				</line>
				<line>Course demands that do not allow for substitutes (Wait-List or No-Sub toggle is checked) are not replaced with a substitute.</line>
			</description>
